=head1 NAME

Test::Block - Specify fine granularity test plans

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::More 'no_plan';
  use Test::Block qw($Plan);

  {
      # This block should run exactly two tests
      local $Plan = 2;
      pass 'first test';
      # oops. forgot second test
  };

  SKIP: {
      local $Plan = 3;
      pass('first test in second block');
      skip "skip remaining tests" => $Plan;
  };

  ok( Test::Block->all_in_block, 'all test run in blocks' );
  is( Test::Block->block_count, 2, 'two blocks ran' );

  # This produces...
  
  ok 1 - first test
  not ok 2 - block expected 2 test(s) and ran 1
  #     Failed test (foo.pl at line 6)
  ok 3 - first test in second block
  ok 4 # skip skip remaining tests
  ok 5 # skip skip remaining tests
  ok 6 - all test run in blocks
  ok 7 - two blocks ran
  1..7
  # Looks like you failed 1 tests of 7.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to specify the number of expected tests at a finer level of granularity than an entire test script. It is built with L<Test::Builder> and plays happily with L<Test::More> and friends.

If you are not already familiar with L<Test::More> now would be the time to go take a look.


=head2 Creating test blocks

Test::Block supplies a special variable C<$Plan> that you can localize to specify the number of tests in a block like this:

    use Test::More 'no_plan';
    use Test::Block qw($Plan);
    
    {
        local $Plan = 2;
        pass('first test');
        pass('second test');
    };
    
=head2 What if the block runs a different number of tests?
    
If a block doesn't run the number of tests specified in C<$Plan> then Test::Block will automatically produce a failing test. For example:

    {
        local $Plan = 2;
        pass('first test');
        # oops - forgot second test
    };

will output

    ok 1 - first test
    not ok 2 - block 1 expected 2 test(s) and ran 1

=head2 Tracking the number of remaining tests

During the execution of a block C<$Plan> will contain the number of remaining tests that are expected to run so:

    {
        local $Plan = 2;
        diag "$Plan tests to run";
        pass('first test');
        diag "$Plan tests to run";
        pass('second test');
        diag "$Plan tests to run";
    };

will produce

    # 2 tests to run
    ok 1 - first test
    # 1 tests to run
    ok 2 - second test
    # 0 tests to run

This can make skip blocks easier to write and maintain, for example:

    SKIP: {
        local $Plan = 5;
        pass('first test');
        pass('second test');
        skip "debug tests" => $Plan unless DEBUG > 0;
        pass('third test');
        pass('fourth test');
        skip "high level debug tests" => $Plan unless DEBUG > 2;
        pass('fifth test');
    };


=head2 Named blocks

To make debugging easier you can give your blocks an optional name like this:

    {
        local $Plan = { example => 2 };
        pass('first test');
        # oops - forgot second test
    };

which would output

    ok 1 - first test
    not ok 2 - block example expected 2 test(s) and ran 1


=head2 Test::Block objects

The C<$Plan> is implemented using a tied variable that stores and retrieves Test::Block objects. If you want to avoid the tied interface you can use Test::Block objects directly.

=over 4

=item B<plan>

  # create a block expecting 4 tests
  my $block = Test::Block->plan(4);

  # create a named block with two tests
  my $block = Test::Block->plan('test name' => 2);

You create Test::Block objects with the C<plan> method. When the object is destroyed it outputs a failing test if the expected number of tests have not run. 


=item B<remaining>

You can find out the number of remaining tests in the block by calling the C<remaining> method on the object. 

Test::Block objects overload C<""> and C<0+> to return the result of the remaining method.


=item B<builder>

Returns L<Test::Builder> object used by Test::Block. For example:

  Test::Block->builder->skip('skip a test');

See L<Test::Builder> for more information.


=item B<block_count>

A class method that returns the number of blocks that have been created. You can use this to check that the expected number of blocks have run by doing something like:

  is( Test::Block->block_count, 5, 'five blocks run' );

at the end of your test script.


=item B<all_in_block>

Returns true if all tests so far run have been inside the scope of a Test::Block object.

  ok( Test::Block->all_in_block, 'all tests run in blocks' );
