=head1 NAME

Test::Block - specify fine granularity test plans

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::More 'no_plan';
  use Test::Block qw($Plan);

  {
      # This block should run exactly two tests
      # and is named 'foo'
      local $Plan = { tests => 2, name => 'foo' };
      pass 'first test in first block';
      # oops. forgot second test
  };

  SKIP: {
      # This block should run exactly three tests 
      local $Plan = 3;
      pass('first test in second block');
      skip "skip remaining tests", $Plan;
  };

  ok( Test::Block->all_in_block, 'all test run in blocks' );
  is( Test::Block->block_count, 2, 'two blocks ran' );

  # Above produces the following output.
  ok 1 - first test in first block
  not ok 2 - block 'foo' expected 2 test(s) and ran 1
  ok 3 - first test in second block
  ok 4 # skip skip remaining tests
  ok 5 # skip skip remaining tests
  ok 6 - all test run in blocks
  ok 7 - two blocks ran
  1..7


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to specify the number of expected tests at a finer level of granuality than an entire test script. It is built with L<Test::Builder> and plays happily with L<Test::More> and friends.

If you are not already familiar with L<Test::More> now would be the time to go take a look.


=over 4

=item B<plan>

  # create a block expecting 4 tests
  my $block = Test::Block->plan(4);

  # create a named block with two tests
  my $block = Test::Block->plan(tests=>2, name=>'fribble');

You create Test::Block objects with the C<plan> method. When the object is destroyed it outputs a failing test if the expected number of tests have not run. For example doing:

  {
      my $block = Test::Block->plan(tests => 3, name => 'foo');
      ok(1);
      # oops - missed two tests out
  }

will produce

  ok 1
  not ok 2 - block 'foo' expected 3 test(s) and ran 1


=item B<$Test::Block::Plan>

C<$Test::Block::Plan> is a tied variable that allows you to easily create and localise Test::Block objects. Rather than doing:

  use Test::Block;
  {
      my $block = Test::Block->plan(tests => 3, name => 'foo');
      ...
  }
  {
      my $block = Test::Block->plan(4);
      ...
  }

you can do:

  use Test::Block qw($Plan);
  {
      local $Plan = {tests => 3, name => 'foo'};
      ...
  }
  {
      local $Plan = 4;
      ...
  }


=item B<remaining>

You can find out the number of remaining tests in the block by calling the C<remaining> method on the object. Doing:

  {
      my $block = Test::Block->plan(2);
      diag $block->remaining . " test(s) left";
      pass 'first test';
      diag $block->remaining . " test(s) left";
      pass 'second test';
      diag $block->remaining . " test(s) left";
  };

produces

  # 2 test(s) left
  ok 1 - first test
  # 1 test(s) left
  ok 2 - second test
  # 0 test(s) left
  1..2

Test::Block objects overload C<""> and C<0+> to return the result of the remaining method, so the previous example can be written as:

  {
      my $block = Test::Block->plan(2);
      diag "$block test(s) left";
      pass 'first test';
      diag "$block test(s) left";
      pass 'second test';
      diag "$block test(s) left";
  };

Combined with L<$Test::Block::Plan> it can make C<SKIP> blocks with multiple exit points much easier to manage, for example:

  SKIP: {
      local $Plan = 3;
      pass 'level 0 test';

      skip 'test level < 1' => $Plan if TEST_LEVEL < 1;
      pass 'level 1 test';

      skip 'test level < 2' => $Plan if TEST_LEVEL < 2;        
      pass 'level 2 test';
  };


=item B<builder>

Returns L<Test::Builder> object used by Test::Block. For example:

  Test::Block->builder->skip('skip a test');

See L<Test::Builder> for more information.


=item B<block_count>

A class method that returns the number of blocks that have been created. You can use this to check that the expected number of blocks have run by doing something like:

  is( Test::Block->block_count, 5, 'five blocks run' );

at the end of your test script.


=item B<all_in_block>

Returns true if all tests so far run have been inside the scope of a Test::Block object.

  ok( Test::Block->all_in_block, 'all tests run in blocks' );
